Q1 - How do I initialize empty objects in Ember? I have:
    selectedPostData: {},
    userData: {},
  in app.js. There is an Ember way to initialize empty arrays, but I haven't
  found the corresponding method for objects (the server complains about this).

  I ended up just doing:
    selectedPostData: null,
    userData: null,
  and it worked.

Q2 - I can attach a click action to a div or span and it works fine. Why does
  the server complain about it?

  I ended up changing the 'div' to a 'button' and it worked.

Q3 - How do I get rid of jQuery deprecation warnings that show up during test
  and also in the 'inspect' window of Chrome?
