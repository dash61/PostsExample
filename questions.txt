Q1 - How do I initialize empty objects in Ember? I have:
    selectedPostData: {},
    userData: {},
  in app.js. There is an Ember way to initialize empty arrays, but I haven't
  found the corresponding method for objects (the server complains about this).

Q2 - I can attach a click action to a div or span and it works fine. Why does
  the server complain about it? What is the work-around?
